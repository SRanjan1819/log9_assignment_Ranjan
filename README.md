## Thought Process Behind Developing This App
The primary objective was to create a tool that could provide actionable insights based on customer behavior. Simulated customer data was used to make the application as realistic as possible without compromising privacy.

### Data Simulation
Simulated data allows us to create a controlled environment where we can understand the impacts of different customer behaviors on our KPIs.

### Data Analysis
The KPIs were chosen to give a well-rounded view of customer behavior and store performance.

### Optimization Suggestions
These are not just generic suggestions; they are computed based on the KPIs to offer tailored marketing strategies.
